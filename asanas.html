					<h3>Sukhasana</h3>
					<p>Sukhasana is one of the most basic yoga asanas and is suitable for yogis of all levels. The name is derived from the Sanskrit word sukha meaning pleasure or comfort and asana, meaning "pose." The pose is entered by sitting on the floor and folding the left leg until it is touching the right thigh. The right leg is then folded so that it touches the left thigh. The hands are kept on the knees and it is common for yogis to use jnana mudra or chin mudra while meditating in this pose. The spine remains erect and the breathing is normal.</p>

					<h3>Navasana</h3>
					<p>Navasana is a seated yoga asana that requires core strength to hold the body in a "V" shape. As well as a range of physical benefits, it is believed to build concentration, stamina and balance. Its name comes from the Sanskrit, nava, which means "boat," and asana, which means "posture" or "seat.‚Äù It is so called because the shape of the body balancing on the buttocks is thought to resemble a boat floating on the water.</p>

					<h3>Natarajasana</h3>
					<p>Natarajasana is a standing asana that requires balance and concentration. Begin by standing straight with arms at the sides. Bend the right leg backward with the heel lifted to the right buttock and the knee bent. The right hand reaches back and grasps the outside of the right foot or ankle. Then the right leg moves up as much as possible, pressing the foot or ankle into the right hand. The left arm is stretched forward, parallel to the floor. This asana is held for a couple of breaths and then repeated on the other side.</p>
